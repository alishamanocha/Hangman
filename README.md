This is a Python replication of the classic game Hangman! It utilizes a dictionary file with over 2500 words in it to randomly select words to be guessed.

Instructions:
1. Enter the size of the word you want to guess (from 3-12). If anything other than the integers 3-12 is entered, a random size will be chosen for you.
2. Enter the number of lives you want to play with (from 1-10). If anything other than the integers 1-10 is entered, you will be given the default of 5 lives.
3. You then will enter letters A-Z (not case sensitive) to attempt to solve for the word in the given amount of lives! You can choose to play again if you wish to.
